# Mann–Whitney U Test (Rally Length Analysis)

This directory contains scripts used to statistically evaluate learning-like
performance changes in the Pong simulation.

Rally length data saved during simulation runs are aggregated across multiple
trials, and early vs. late performance distributions are compared using the
Mann–Whitney U test, following the evaluation strategy used in prior work.
